# Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome Script (.bat)

![](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/raw/master/winPEAS/winPEASexe/images/winpeas.png)

**WinPEAS is a script that searh for possible paths to escalate privileges on Windows hosts. The checks are explained on [book.hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation)**

Check also the **Local Windows Privilege Escalation checklist** from [book.hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation)

### WinPEAS.bat is a batch script made for Windows systems which don't support WinPEAS.exe (Net.4 required)

Unfortunately this script **does not support colors** so you will need to know what are you looking for in each test and, also, you will have to know how to learn the icacls output, see below.

## Windows PE using CMD (.bat)

If you want to search for files and registry that could contain passwords, set to *yes* the *long* variable at the beginning of the script.

The script will use acceschk.exe if it is available (with that name). But it is not necessary, it also uses wmic + icacls.

Some of the tests in this script were extracted from **[here](https://github.com/enjoiz/Privesc/blob/master/privesc.bat)** and from **[here](https://github.com/codingo/OSCP-2/blob/master/Windows/WinPrivCheck.bat)**

### Understanding icacls permissions

Icacls is the program used to check the rights that groups and users have in a file or folder.

Iclals is the main binary used here to check permissions.

Its output is not intuitive so if you are not familiar with the command, continue reading. Take into account that in XP you need administrators rights to use icacls (for this OS is very recommended to upload sysinternals accesschk.exe to enumerate rights).

**Interesting permissions**

```
D - Delete access
F - Full access (Edit_Permissions+Create+Delete+Read+Write)
N - No access
M - Modify access (Create+Delete+Read+Write)
RX - Read and eXecute access
R - Read-only access
W - Write-only access
```

We will focus in **F** (full), **M** (Modify access) and **W** (write).

**Use of Icacls by WinPEAS**

When checking rights of a file or a folder the script search for the strings: *(F)* or *(M)* or *(W)* and the string ":\" (so the path of the file being checked will appear inside the output).

It also checks that the found right (F, M or W) can be exploited by the current user.

A typical output where you dont have any nice access is:
```
C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(F)
```

An output where you have some interesting privilege will be like:
```
C:\Users\john\Desktop\desktop.ini NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                MYDOMAIN\john:(I)(F)
```

Here you can see that the privileges of user *NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM* appears in the output because it is in the same line as the path of the binary. However, in the next line, you can see that our user (john) has full privileges in that file. 

This is the kind of outpuf that you have to look for when usnig the winPEAS.bat script.
