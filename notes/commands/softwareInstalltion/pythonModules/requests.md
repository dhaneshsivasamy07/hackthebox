Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!
Requests is one of the most downloaded Python package today, pulling in around 14M downloads / week— according to GitHub, Requests is currently depended upon by 500,000+ repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.

### Installation

```bash
# via pip
pip install requests
```
